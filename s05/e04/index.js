// s05e04 - ES6 Tooling

// When using modern JS, we need two kinds of tools -
// a transpiler - (translator + compiler) that takes modern JS code and produces legacy-compatible code.
// a bundler - module bundler is responsible for combining all our JS files into a single file, which we call a bundle.
// Bundler also minifies our code (removes spaces) and "uglifies" it (shortens names of objects)
// A recommended transpiler is Babel and recommended bundler is Webpack.
